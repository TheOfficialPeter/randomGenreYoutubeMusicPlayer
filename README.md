# randomGenreYoutubeMusicPlayer
You pick a genre and it will start playing a totally random song within that genre.

### Installation

- You need Selenium, python-vlc and pafy installed using pip and also a webdriver. I chose Chrome webdriver
- Install VLC from their main site
- download main.py
- run main.py

### Update

I updated this repo and it is now using the new yt-dlp library instead of pafy.
