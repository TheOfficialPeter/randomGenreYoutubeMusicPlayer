# randomGenreYoutubeMusicPlayer
You pick a genre and it will start playing a totally random song within that genre.


### Installation

- You need Selenium, python-vlc and pafy installed using pip and also a webdriver. I chose Chrome webdriver
- download main.py
- run main.py

### Update

I think pafy is broken. Not sure. Might fix some other time if I can find a solution
