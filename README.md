# randomGenreYoutubeMusicPlayer
You pick a genre and it will start playing a totally random song within that genre.


### Installation

- You need Selenium, python-vlc and pafy installed using pip and also a webdriver. I chose Chrome webdriver
- download main.py
- run main.py

You might find the installation more difficult than it seems. I was just too lazy to add the full installation. If you want me to add full installation just ask and I'll do it.
